This project is a simple one page application that starts out without any star wars info, but when the user enters a number and clicks submit the app makes an ajax call to the https://swapi.co star wars api, which gives the app information in json form about a certain star wars character, which is then parsed and displayed on the page. 

This was made as a project for a class. It may require the downloading of a chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc/related
